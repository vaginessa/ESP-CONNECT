# What is ESP Connect?

ESP Connect allows you to easily configure your ESP8266-based IoT devices to the internet. In a few easy steps you can go from a brand new device to a configured and working device. It works with ESP8266 nodes that have WiFi Manager (found at https://github.com/kentaylor/WiFiManager) to allow a straight-forward user experience.

1. You simply turn on the configuration mode of your IoT device.
2. Select your IoT device in the app.
3. Enter the credentials of the network to configure it to.
4. Tap "submit".

ESP Connect will connect your phone to the IoT device's hotspot, obtain a list of networks that the IoT device can connect to, configure it, and verify that the configuration was successful.
